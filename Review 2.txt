1.Food recognition is done
2.CNN is used
3.About training model
-Preprocessing:
	-pixel values range[0,1]
	-random rotations upto 40 degree
	-random zoom is applied
	-shear angle in counter-clockwise direction in degrees
-Training model
	-trained 5 categories using classifier in CNN

4.Convolution neural network (LeNet - inventor)
-high accuracy
-advanced algorithms
-information acquisition -> preprocessing -> feature extraction -> classifier design & classifier decision
-Layers 
	-convolution layers
	-pooling layers -spatial attributes
	-sub-sampling layers
	-fully-connected layers
5.Food 101 Dataset
-converted to HDF5 keras matrix
-HDF5(Hierarchical Data Format version 5) is open source file format which uses a file directory which allows to organize data within file in many different structured ways
-resolution around 512x512x3
6.packages used
-Keras neural network api
-Caret classification and regression training
	-data splitting,preprocessing,feature selection,model tuning,
-Shiny
	-An R package used to build interactive webapps
	-It can also extend Shiny apps with CSS themes,html widgets and js actions
-Shiny JS
	-Used to write js functions
-Shiny themes
	-For CSS files
